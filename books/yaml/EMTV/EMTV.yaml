  Text: "A Message from the TranslatorYou are reading the very latest edition (2012)\
    \ of the English Majority Text Version (EMTV).This latest edition has Greek explanatory\
    \ notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings\
    \ in some select places of the original Koine Greek.The Byzantine Majority New\
    \ Testament draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text,\
    \ “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr.\
    \ Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and this edition has incorporated his hard work\
    \ in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading,\
    \ and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the\
    \ book of Revelation reflect these variant readings.This is one of the great things\
    \ about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy\
    \ Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of\
    \ accuracy. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior\
    \ Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do,\
    \ we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given\
    \ to mankind.“Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their\
    \ trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found\
    \ a liar. (Prov 30:5)Peace of Christ to you all.In His service,Paul W. EspositoStauros\

    \ in the traditional texts. The King James reads: “For the mystery of iniquity\
    \ doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of\
    \ the way.” The New American Standard reads: “For the mystery of lawlessness is\
    \ already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out\
    \ of the way.” But the EMTV reads: “For the mystery of lawlessness is already\
    \ at work; only He who now restrains will continue until one arises from out of\
    \ the midst.” I cannot find but one instance of “the way” being used to translate\
    \ “ek mesou”, or “ek mesou genetai”! The literal rendition of this phrase is:\
    \ “Come into being from out of the midst.”"

  Text: "Translator's Note: The Book of Hebrews was the most difficult book to translate\
    \ in the entire New Testament. The man that God used to pen Hebrews used beautiful,\
    \ crisp Greek, very well-defined, and refined. Not to say that the other authors\
    \ did not, or were inferior in any way. From the perspective of a translator,\
    \ let me say that I find it very difficult to believe that the Apostle Paul wrote\
    \ this book, for two reasons: First, the Greek style is nothing like his own.\
    \ There are none of Paul's favorite colloquialisms in the Book of Hebrews. Second,\
    \ and most important, the writer of this book apparently did not know Hebrew!\
    \ Every single Old Testament quotation in Hebrews is out of the Greek Old Testament.\
    \ This author didn't seem to have the Hebrew Scriptures available to him. Which\
    \ certainly is strange, if the writer was Paul. Ou monon de, if the writer was\
    \ Paul, he wouldn't need to have the Hebrew Scriptures in front of him–he knew\
    \ them by heart–as any good Pharisee would! Also, may I point out that as a result\
    \ of the difficulty (at times) in the translating process of Hebrews, that I have\
    \ retained the literal translation of certain Scriptures, instead of paraphrasing,\
    \ to make it easier to understand. I have made the decision NOT to attempt to\
    \ decide what the writer meant, but to literally translate what the writer WROTE,\
    \ instead, and I have left the interpretation to the reader. Case in point: Hebrews\
    \ 6:1 The King James reads thusly: Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine\
    \ of Christ, let us go on to perfection. The New American Standard reads: Therefore\
    \ leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity...\
    \ But, the EMTV here reads literally: Therefore, leaving the subject of the beginning\
    \ of Christ, let us be moved to perfection... The Greek word used here, that some\
    \ have translated principles, or elementary, is the word Arche , which means,\
    \ beginning . En Arche en ho Logos – In the beginning was the Word. There are\

  Text: "Translator's Note: The Book of the Revelation, no doubt, is the premier book\
    \ of the New Testament that brings with it the most controversy, from a translator's\
    \ and/or manuscript's perspective. Also, from a Majority Text perspective as well,\
    \ as it was a difficult to find one clear cut majority out of all the vast differences\
    \ in available manuscripts. When Erasmus was gathering together all the existing\
    \ Byzantine manuscripts, in order to make one superior manuscript, to translate\
    \ into Latin, he didn't have many options to choose from. There were perhaps eight\
    \ or so Greek Manuscripts that he had at his disposal. BUT, he only had one manuscript\
    \ of the Book of the Revelation, and that copy was found wanting in many places.\
    \ History has it, that he had to go back to the Latin, and re-translate a few\
    \ passages back into Greek. Since that time, many more manuscripts have been discovered\
    \ from that area. This does NOT include the corrupt manuscripts (in my opinion)\
    \ that have been discovered in the Alexandria, Egypt area. This translation of\
    \ the Book of Revelation comes from the majority of the same trustworthy manuscripts\
    \ that the King James Bible comes from. Martin Luther, John Calvin, The Geneva\
    \ Bible– All these translations come from the same time-tested, faithful manuscripts\
    \ that God has preserved throughout time. Please pay careful attention to the\
    \ Majority Text Version of the Book of the Revelation. It is full of interesting\
    \ differences, and there are some verses that we all have never read quite like\
    \ this before. I want to thank Dr. Wilbur Pickering for his outstanding work in\
    \ textual criticism (which I drew from, with his permission), and for his evidence\
    \ in proving just what does constitute a Majority Text reading. In this regard,\
    \ you will find the Book of the Revelation (as well as John 7:53-8:11) different\
    \ from the Hodges/Farstad Text, but yet in agreement with what constitutes a majority\
    \ reading of the available Byzantine texts. As long as we can come to trust the\
    \ source of the manuscripts, then we're assured to enjoy a fascinating, and interesting\
    \ reading into the awesome word of our Father, Jehovah God, and of His Son, the\
    \ Living Word of the Living God–Jesus Christ. It's my prayer that you find this\
    \ English Majority Text reading of this Book, as well as the entire New Testament,\
    \ to be spirit-filled, and trustworthy, and faithful to the Lord God, to the best\
    \ of my ability.Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their\
    \ trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found\
    \ a liar. (Prov 30:5-6)God bless you, Paul W. Esposito Translator, English Majority\
