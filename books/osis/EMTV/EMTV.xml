            A Message from the TranslatorYou are reading the very latest edition (2012) of the English Majority Text Version (EMTV).This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek.The Byzantine Majority New Testament draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and this edition has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings.This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind.“Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prov 30:5)Peace of Christ to you all.In His service,Paul W.

            Isa 7:14&quot;BEHOLD, THE &quot;VIRGIN&quot; parthenos, Gk.: (noun). &quot;A Virgin. Interestingly, Matthew here is quoting Isaiah 7:14 from the Greek Septuagint. Which uses the unmistakable word Parthenos, virgin, for Jesus’ mother, Mary (Miriam, Gk) and is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word &quot;Almah,&quot; meaning a young woman of marriageable age. However, make no mistake about it–there's only one way to interpret the Greek word parthenos, and that is &quot;virgin&quot;. Also, the word is used figuratively for a church in 2 Cor 11:2, and in Rev 14:4 as a masculine noun for chaste or celibate men.&quot;VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD, AND SHALL BRING FORTH A SON, AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL,&quot; which is translated, &quot;GOD WITH US.&quot;

Python was the name given to the serpent that kept guard at Delphi, slain by Apollo, who was called Puthios Apollo and the prophetess at Delphi was termed Pythia. Certainly Luke does not mean to credit Apollo with a real existence (1 Cor 8:4). But Plutarch (a.d. 50-100) says that the term puthones was applied to ventriloquists (eggastrimuthoi). In the lxx those with familiar spirits are called by this word ventriloquists (Lev_19:31; Lev_20:6, Lev_20:27, including the witch of Endor 1Sa_28:7).Python, met us, who brought much profit to her masters by fortune telling.

The other is ou (ouk, ouki). The difference is: Me is used for something that is already assumed. Also, “ou” denies the fact, while “me” denies the idea. When these two words are combined, (ou me), we have a double negative, another absolute emphatic declaration, usually translated by no means! in the EMTV.By no means!

The King James reads: “For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.” The New American Standard reads: “For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.” But the EMTV reads: “For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains will continue until one arises from out of the midst.” I cannot find but one instance of “the way” being used to translate “ek mesou”, or “ek mesou genetai”!

            Translator's Note: The Book of Hebrews was the most difficult book to translate in the entire New Testament. The man that God used to pen Hebrews used beautiful, crisp Greek, very well-defined, and refined. Not to say that the other authors did not, or were inferior in any way. From the perspective of a translator, let me say that I find it very difficult to believe that the Apostle Paul wrote this book, for two reasons: First, the Greek style is nothing like his own. There are none of Paul's favorite colloquialisms in the Book of Hebrews. Second, and most important, the writer of this book apparently did not know Hebrew! Every single Old Testament quotation in Hebrews is out of the Greek Old Testament. This author didn't seem to have the Hebrew Scriptures available to him. Which certainly is strange, if the writer was Paul. Ou monon de, if the writer was Paul, he wouldn't need to have the Hebrew Scriptures in front of him–he knew them by heart–as any good Pharisee would! Also, may I point out that as a result of the difficulty (at times) in the translating process of Hebrews, that I have retained the literal translation of certain Scriptures, instead of paraphrasing, to make it easier to understand. I have made the decision NOT to attempt to decide what the writer meant, but to literally translate what the writer WROTE, instead, and I have left the interpretation to the reader. Case in point: Hebrews 6:1 The King James reads thusly: Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection. The New American Standard reads: Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity... But, the EMTV here reads literally: Therefore, leaving the subject of the beginning of Christ, let us be moved to perfection... The Greek word used here, that some have translated principles, or elementary, is the word Arche , which means, beginning . En Arche en ho Logos – In the beginning was the Word. There are a few other differences, one in particular in chapter 11. God bless you as you study His word.Paul W.

            Translator's Note: The Book of the Revelation, no doubt, is the premier book of the New Testament that brings with it the most controversy, from a translator's and/or manuscript's perspective. Also, from a Majority Text perspective as well, as it was a difficult to find one clear cut majority out of all the vast differences in available manuscripts. When Erasmus was gathering together all the existing Byzantine manuscripts, in order to make one superior manuscript, to translate into Latin, he didn't have many options to choose from. There were perhaps eight or so Greek Manuscripts that he had at his disposal. BUT, he only had one manuscript of the Book of the Revelation, and that copy was found wanting in many places. History has it, that he had to go back to the Latin, and re-translate a few passages back into Greek. Since that time, many more manuscripts have been discovered from that area. This does NOT include the corrupt manuscripts (in my opinion) that have been discovered in the Alexandria, Egypt area. This translation of the Book of Revelation comes from the majority of the same trustworthy manuscripts that the King James Bible comes from. Martin Luther, John Calvin, The Geneva Bible– All these translations come from the same time-tested, faithful manuscripts that God has preserved throughout time. Please pay careful attention to the Majority Text Version of the Book of the Revelation. It is full of interesting differences, and there are some verses that we all have never read quite like this before. I want to thank Dr. Wilbur Pickering for his outstanding work in textual criticism (which I drew from, with his permission), and for his evidence in proving just what does constitute a Majority Text reading. In this regard, you will find the Book of the Revelation (as well as John 7:53-8:11) different from the Hodges/Farstad Text, but yet in agreement with what constitutes a majority reading of the available Byzantine texts. As long as we can come to trust the source of the manuscripts, then we're assured to enjoy a fascinating, and interesting reading into the awesome word of our Father, Jehovah God, and of His Son, the Living Word of the Living God–Jesus Christ. It's my prayer that you find this English Majority Text reading of this Book, as well as the entire New Testament, to be spirit-filled, and trustworthy, and faithful to the Lord God, to the best of my ability.Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prov 30:5-6)God bless you, Paul W.
